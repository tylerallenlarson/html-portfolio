<h1>The Best Movies According to Tyler</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>The Indiana Jones Series</h3>
<p>Who wouldn't want to join Indy on his adventures around the world racing to find ancient treasure before it falls into the hands of evil doers with the primary means for defense is a bullwhip?</p>
<h3>Dante's Peak</h3>
<p>This movie was so exciting and informative it made me consider becoming a volconologist..</p>
<h3>The Grinch</h3>
<p>I watch this Christmas classic even when it's not the holiday season it is so good.  This was Jim Carey's best comedic performance of all time.</p>
